        Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity
        for peaceful cooperation many never come again. But why, some say, the moon?
    </p>

        because they are easy, but because they are hard.

                The most significant things we can think about, when we think about Apollo, is that it has opened for us, 
                for us being the World, a challenge of the future. The door is now cracked,
